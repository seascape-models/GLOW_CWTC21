Coastal managed realignment is the deliberate process of realigning an estuary and/or coastal defences. It creates space for new intertidal habitats (saltmarshes and mudflats) that provide a variety of ecosystem services and are home to many coastal species #CWTC21 1/5 https://t.co/u2QvPsFDA8,25,82,James Robinson,3156,2084
"Saltmarsh &amp; Mangrove ecosystems are important #NatureBasedSolutions to #ClimateChange, removing carbon from the environment &amp; storing it at very high rates. Most of this #BlueCarbon is stored in the soil, but amounts can be highly variable #CWTC21 @globalwetlands 1/5 https://t.co/ksYsGoXR9I",24,91,Sophie Russell,126,157
"Mangrove forests sequester disproportionally large amounts of CO2 &amp; thus there is considerable interest in restoration to mitigate &amp; adapt to climate change. #Restoration can provide multiple ecosystem service benefits, such coastal protection &amp; supporting fisheries #CWTC21 1/5 https://t.co/PnhFp4IpDr",23,82,Tom Worthington,283,235
"Coastal wetlands dont get enough attention in the international policy arena  think #SGDs #CBD  but why? 

We looked at the inclusion of wetlands in global #ecosystem assessment frameworks and highlight gaps in data that hinder uptake

"#Seagrasses are important coastal ecosystems that are increasingly threatened by human activities

We need to know where and why seagrasses are in decline to improve management

"Human-induced stressors are impacting coastal ecosystems globally. The impact of individual stressors can be accurately quantified. Cumulative impact assessments (CIAs), aim to accurately predict the combined impact of multiple stressors #CWTC21 (1/5) https://t.co/VaF0FRRxrf",21,64,Jackson Stockbridge,396,458

"Seagrass meadows are disturbed by several stressors, e.g. bioturbation by the #NIS lugworm Arenicola spp.
We show Nature-based Solutions foster #seagrass resilience &amp; #restoration success, propose guidelines for restoration practitioners &amp; set up an upscaling program.

"#Restoration of #mangroves is happening all over the world, motivated by local &amp; global initiatives &amp; targets. But we currently struggle to track what impact were having.
