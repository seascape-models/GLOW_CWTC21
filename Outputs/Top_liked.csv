"Saltmarsh &amp; Mangrove ecosystems are important #NatureBasedSolutions to #ClimateChange, removing carbon from the environment &amp; storing it at very high rates. Most of this #BlueCarbon is stored in the soil, but amounts can be highly variable #CWTC21 @globalwetlands 1/5 https://t.co/ksYsGoXR9I",24,91,Sophie Russell,126,157

"Mangrove forests sequester disproportionally large amounts of CO2 &amp; thus there is considerable interest in restoration to mitigate &amp; adapt to climate change. #Restoration can provide multiple ecosystem service benefits, such coastal protection &amp; supporting fisheries #CWTC21 1/5 https://t.co/PnhFp4IpDr",23,82,Tom Worthington,283,235

Coastal managed realignment is the deliberate process of realigning an estuary and/or coastal defences. It creates space for new intertidal habitats (saltmarshes and mudflats) that provide a variety of ecosystem services and are home to many coastal species #CWTC21 1/5 https://t.co/u2QvPsFDA8,25,82,James Robinson,3156,2084
"#Mangroverestoration can provide multiple ecosystem service &amp; biodiversity benefits. However, information on mangrove restoration is disparate, with project outcomes and failures often underreported. Here, we review the consistency of reporting in published literature #CWTC21 1/5 https://t.co/VssMESwDq1",16,80,Yasmine Gatt,155,270
"In Gulf of Mexico coastal wetlands, warmer winter temps = more black #mangroves (Avicennia germinans). So what happened in the ecotone after sub-zero temps hit the TX coast in Feb 2021? Will mangroves recover, or will marsh plants take over? Follow along to find out#CWTC21 1/5 https://t.co/HEpOsdXHJt",15,73,Anna Armitage,1096,1291

"Human-induced stressors are impacting coastal ecosystems globally. The impact of individual stressors can be accurately quantified.
